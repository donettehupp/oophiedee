Hi! Please don't upvote this too much as most people aren't interested. -- I've been listening to 'classical' music for only about a year now and I would like some recommendations. I've looked through the sidebars and at many playlists. Through my year of listening I've really come to like Tchaikovsky the most. Some of my favorite pieces of his are the Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake, and Nutcracker suites; les seasons; and just about everything else. -- As far as instrumentation I love hearing I'm a casual classical music fan. I have a familiarity with classical music, the eras and composers, and there are certain pieces I love and return to again and again. But I mostly listen to film scores. Film scores are recorded in studio, and mixed to achieve a certain kind of emotional feel. They are often mixed "unrealistically" -- in real life you might not be able to highlight that section or instrument suddenly when before it was recessed, or you might not be able to have the soundscape. Hey christmas folks. I have been boycotting all pop phenomenons (all the "pop classics"), rat pack songs and other reinterpretations of so called christmas music for quite some time now. I also have been listening to Tchaikovsky for years now. Especially his ballet suits (Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake and of course nutcracker). I am asking you guys out there, what kind of other classical music can I listen to except Tchaikovsky. Just now I also discovered Shostakovichs "Jazz Suite". Extremely fitti. So I‚Äôve been avoiding the hell suits a little. I have all the chapters finished and pretty much everything else I can do with maiden drops, plus most of the princess evolution suits. I know I should start on a hell suit but I just can‚Äôt seem to bring myself to do it. I know I‚Äôm gonna sound like a hater, but I don‚Äôt know that I care enough to work on them. I like some parts of Grice (like that hair is so pretty) but I‚Äôm not super in love with the whole suit (or the recolor) I love music from the Romantic Era. So far I know of Boston Symphony Orchestra / Seiji Ozawa recorded in 1978 for Swan Lake (https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/boston-symphony-orchestra-seiji-ozawa/swan-lake/) and Kirov Orchestra / Valery Gergiev recorded in 1998 for The Nutcracker. (https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/kirov-orchestra-valery-gergiev/the-nutcracker/) I also love Scheherazade. I‚Äôve seen plenty of swans in my life and each experience is accompanied by someone saying something like ‚Äúwow, just beautiful‚Äù. Not only do I fail to see the beauty but they are overrated and vicious when they want/need to be. Likely a result of my general fear of birds, but take one look at those bills and tell me there‚Äôs no fear in your heart. Hell/lifetime suits like star sea, grice and stunning beauty just don't cut it next to the beautiful suits that can be crafted with 10x less effort, imo ü§î I get that ppl wanna craft them bc it's a challenge, but if only the reward was better üòÖ are they like, rlly old suits? I know star sea is but the other too? they might have looked gorgeous 3 years ago but right now. not worth. WELCOME .
